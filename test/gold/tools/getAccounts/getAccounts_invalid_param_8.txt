	-n  (--named)         Include well know token and airdrop addresses in the search
	-a  (--addr)          display only addresses in the results (useful for scripting)

#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)
	-x  (--fmt val)       export format (one of [none|json|txt|csv|api])
	-t  (--other)         export other addresses if found
#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)

	-h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:
	- With a single search term, the tool searches both name and address.
	- With two search terms, the first term must match the address field, and the second term must match the name field.
	- When there are two search terms, both must match.
	- The --matchCase option requires case sensitive matching. It works with all other options.
	- To customize the list of names add a custom section to the config file (see documentation).
