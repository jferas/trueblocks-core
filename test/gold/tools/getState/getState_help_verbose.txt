  Notes:
	- addresses must start with '0x' and be forty two characters long.
	- block_list may be a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
	- This tool retrieves information from the local node or rpcProvider if configured (see documentation).
	- If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
	- special blocks are detailed under whenBlock --list.
	- balance is the default mode. To select a single mode use none first, followed by that mode.
	- You may specify multiple modes on a single line.
